# Open Educational Resources for Algorithmic Decision-Making in Neuroscience

## What is the purpose of this project?
 
We aim to raise awareness about algorithmic decision-making in the field of neuroscience by building an open curriculum
 
## Project summary
 
As the amount and complexity of data collected in neuroscience increases, advanced algorithmic techniques have become imperative for analysing them. In particular, machine learning (ML) is used to infer intentions based on neural activity, in an attempt to control external devices. Algorithmic decisions can majorly improve the lives of patients suffering from neurological disorders, e.g. through neural implants that automatically detect and stop epileptic seizures before they occur, or by enabling communication in individuals who cannot control their bodies. While the use of algorithms has an enormous potential for bringing positive change, this comes with a huge cost, as algorithms are often treated as a black box.
In interdisciplinary fields such as neuroscience, there is often a gap in expertise, as researchers come from very diverse fields as psychology vs. engineering. As a result, researchers from less computational  fields might be using algorithms without fully understanding their assumptions, while researchers who are developing algorithms may not be fully aware of the social and ethical implications of their use (i.e. privacy, stigma).
The main goal of this proposal is to raise awareness about the use of algorithmic decision-making in the field of neuroscience by building an open educational resource. This will consist of developing and releasing material for a semester-long course,  on the appropriate use of ML and signal-processing techniques for analysing neuroscientific data. The course will comprise of a mixture of theory and hands-on exercises, aiming at making computational techniques accessible to all academic and citizen scientists.
The requested budget will be used to hire a part-time research assistant, who will develop and test Jupyter Notebooks, and will integrate those for MyBinder and Jupyter Book, so that the resources can be used by anyone with an internet connection.
After releasing a first version, the applicant will use it for teaching a newly formed course at the University of Bern, Switzerland, for master students of computer science and neuroscience, which will help in refining the course material. To drive further community engagement, students of this course and anyone interested in neuroscience/ML, will be encouraged to contribute with their own notebooks, or additional material. Contributors will be sought out at online and in-person open science events (i.e. Global Sprint, Brainhack).
