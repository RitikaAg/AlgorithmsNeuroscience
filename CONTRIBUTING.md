# Contributing to "Algorithms in Neuroscience"

Many thanks for your interest in this project! :relaxed: :tada: :brain:

We aim to raise awareness about algorithmic decision-making in the field of neuroscience. We welcome new contributors and will be delighted to have your input! Bellow is a list of guidelines for helping in this project.
Please keep in mind that these are just guidelines, not rules! We particularly welcome new ideas or different perspectives!

# Getting started
* Before starting, please take a moment to check our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/aath0/AlgorithmsNeuroscience/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* A list of open issues and future directions can be found in our [Roadmap](https://github.com/aath0/AlgorithmsNeuroscience/issues/1).

# How to contribute
We do have a [roadmap](https://github.com/aath0/AlgorithmsNeuroscience/issues/1) file, with a list of things we want to achieve in the next few months. 
Additionally, on the [issues](https://github.com/aath0/AlgorithmsNeuroscience/issues) page, you can find some topics where you could contribute. Some of the things we are currently working on are:

* Create some tutorials for pre-processing electroencephalography (EEG) data
* Expand on tutorials for applying machine learning algorithms in neuroscience
* Work on some tutorials with simulated data, to give a better understanding of algorithmic techniques
* Deciding which other topics we should pursue
* Bringing everything together with JupyterBook

# Get in touch
You can always [open issues](https://github.com/aath0/AlgorithmsNeuroscience/issues) for any problems or new ideas that you may have. Also, feel free to email athina.tz@gmail.com if we can help with something!
