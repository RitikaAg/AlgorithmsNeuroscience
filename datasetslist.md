Before starting with this data, we review below some other alternatives.

##Datasets in Matlab (from the EEGLAB software tutorial) are:

Mind wandering: 2 subjects with 11 sessions each performing a mind wandering experiment. See the paper here (data published 2017).

Psychophysics (4Mb): One subject (80 trials) from a visual attention task (32-channel; Matlab format).

Psychophysics (450Mb): 5 subjects with and 2 conditions (64 channels, Matlab format).

Psychophysics, various tasks (1Gb): more than 100 datasets available.

#Other EEG databases or datasets known to us are:

Temple University hospital repository: 12,000 patients 16-channel EEG EDF files

The DREAMS Sleep Spindles Database: a collection of file and sleep scoring on 8 people (only 5 EEG channels).

EEG dataset with 109 subjects published on PhysioNet: From Gerwin Schalk's team at the Wadworth center in Albany, NY.

EEG database for BCI applications. Various experiments are featured.

Psychophysics (700 Mb): 122 subjects recorded using 64 channel (Alcoholic and Controls performing a visual matching task).The limitation of this data is that only data epochs (0 to 1 second after stimulus presentation) is available. After decompressing the files, Matlab scripts to import to EEGLAB are available here (single epoch import and full subject import).

DEAP dataset: EEG (and other modalities) emotion recognition.

Epilepsy data: A very comprehensive database of epilepsy data files.

Epilepsy data: a few small files (text format).

Sleep data: Sleep EEG from 8 subjects (EDF format).

Motor imagery data: Motor imagery data for BCI project (Matlab files).

Animal and human EEG: few trials of EEG data from rats, visual evoked potential, epilepsy, and rest.

Continuous EEG: few seconds of 64-channel EEG recording from an alcoholic patient.
